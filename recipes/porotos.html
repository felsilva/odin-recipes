      <h1>Receta Porotos Con Riendas</h1>
      <p>
        September is the independence of Chile month, and here in the US, it is also Hispanic Heritage Month since many <br>
        Caribbean and South American countries that were Spanish colonies also celebrate their independence during this month.
        <br> This dish is not part of the classic cuisine in the celebrations of Chilean Independence Day, but it is a very Chilean dish. 
        <br> Tasty and substantial, coveted in winter, although in my family, we enjoy it year-round because it was a favorite of many.
