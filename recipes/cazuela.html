        Chilean Chicken Soup “Cazuela de Pollo” is ubiquitous in Chilean houses.
        Each family has its favorite secrets and ingredients, so feel free to
        modify them. <br />
        I’ve never been a friend of soups. Give me creams of vegetables all
        year, but soups, not much. And my uncles, who always, instead of
        helping, caused more discord with their jokes, had me one summer, when I
        was six years old, convinced that the soup was made with seagulls
        instead of chicken, and of course, there was no way to make me eat it.
        As an adult, I wonder what seagull soup will taste like.
